NDG Character Rebinding AHK Script
Originally created by Blaise
-----------------------------------
This script was made to allow easy changing of keybinds for different characters.
Change INPUTCOMMAND as you see fit for a command, when in-game, type tchar(1,2,3,4,5,6) to load that characters keybinds.
When you type in the command, do not press any buttons in the process as it will disturb the script and what it is doing.
